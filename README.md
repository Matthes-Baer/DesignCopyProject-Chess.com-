This project is an approach to approximately copy the design of https://www.chess.com/.

For the editing I didn't use any CSS framework. It was basically intended to be a first frontend challenge for which I would have to work with my CSS knowledge in order to find fitting similar solutions instead of quickly achieving results using Bootstrap5 or Tailwind CSS for example.

Due to the fact that I didn't copy any code through the console, some measurements are not identical with the ones from the original website (https://www.chess.com/). The goal was not to create an exact copy but to use the chess.com landing page as design guide in order to see if I am able to provide the required pure HTML and CSS skills for a landing page which looks somewhat similar.

In addition I added some little JavaScript code to the main chessboard on the top (instead of an pure image I decided to work with a grid and added possible starting moves for the pawns as well as for the knights). Besides that, especially the responsive design has major differences in contrast to the original chess.com web page. I also didn't use any CSS frameworks for responsive design purposes and manually worked with media queries - my design solution ended up to be somewhat differing. Again, especially for the responsive design, it can be seen that I didn't have the goal to create a complete copy but to work with the chess.com web page as a leading guide with the opportunity to use a different approach for some cases.

The used sources (espiaclly icons) can be found in the footer.
